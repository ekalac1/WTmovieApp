            <h3>Where did all of your data come from? <br></h3>

<p>You! Since starting this project in 2008, we've been lucky enough to have users just like you add and edit missing/incorrect data. Think of TMDb as a very specialised version of Wikipedia where everything is editable but very specialised around only movie, TV and actor data. We started with an initial data contribution from a project called omdb with only 10,000 movies in 2009. Everything added and edited since then has been users just like you! <br>

In October 2013, we finally added TV. Since we didn't want to start with an empty database we opted to bring an intial import of data from Freebase. Freebase is made up of a number of different sources but primarily those from Wikipedia, The TVDb and TV Rage. <br> </p>
